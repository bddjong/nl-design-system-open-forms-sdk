# Summary progress

The summary progress displays a short summary of the steps, including the number of the current step
and the number of the total steps of the form. The total number of the steps is updated accordingly
when there are logic rules which may define in a different way the steps through the form
submission.

## Form start

On initial load, no submission is available yet, and the summary is not visible.
