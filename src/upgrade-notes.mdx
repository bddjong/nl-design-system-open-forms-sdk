# Upgrading from 2.0.x to 2.1.x

In the Open Forms SDK 2.1 we've refactor the app scaffolding to simplify the CSS and markup used,
fix a number of bugs and add the ability to tweak the appearance through design tokens.

This mostly affects used-to-be private API, but if you have or had custom CSS overrides for this,
they are likely broken. Users that do not override the default Open Forms theme are not affected.

## Summary of changes

- The `.openforms-layout*` classes, markup and associated design tokens are gone
- The outer container is now the `AppDisplay` component, with the `.openforms-app` class name and
  associated `--of-app-*` design tokens. We now place elements using CSS grid to appropriately
  target styling for mobile devices.
- `FormDisplay` is now a thin wrapper around `AppDisplay` and can no longer be overridden. This
  display configuration is still considered experimental.

## Detailed changes and how to upgrade

### `.utrecht-document` class and design tokens

We do not create an element with the `utrecht-document` and `utrecht-document--surface` class names,
but they are expected by the SDK. If you are embedding forms on your CMS/website, please make sure a
parent of the form root has these class names.

You can then use the following design tokens for basic styles:

- `--utrecht-document-background-color`
- `--utrecht-document-color`
- `--utrecht-document-font-family`
- `--utrecht-document-font-size`
- `--utrecht-document-font-weight`
- `--utrecht-document-line-height`

These properties are inherited when not explicitly set.

### App component

The app component is the outer shell that creates the layout of the form body, progress indicator
(sidebar on desktop, dropdown menu on mobile) and the language selection buttons.

Currently, we have set default values for the design tokens, but they will be removed in SDK 3.0.

Relevant design tokens:

- `--of-app-body-padding-block-{end,start}`: additional vertical spacing for the main content
- `--of-app-grid-column-gap`: spacing between main content and progress indicator, on devices larger
  than mobile.

**Mobile**

- `--of-app-body-mobile-padding-block-{end,start}`: vertical spacing between main content and
  progress indicator/debug information
- `--of-app-mobile-grid-row-gap`: vertical spacing between components
- `--of-app-mobile-padding-{block,inline}-{end,start}`: padding between content and device edges
- `--of-app-progress-indicator-mobile-margin-inline-{end,start}`: margin for the progress indicator.
  Setting this to the negative inline padding values above will stretch the button across the full
  width of the screen.
- `--of-app-progress-indicator-mobile-inset-block-start`: offset of the sticky toggle button/header
  to the top of the screen - set to a non-zero value if your own menu should always visible in the
  screen.

### Card component

The card component is used to wrap the main body content (the form fields, some modals...). It used
to have hardcoded colors/paddings but they are now customizable through design tokens.

Currently, we have set default values for the design tokens, but they may be removed in SDK 3.0.

Relevant design tokens:

- `--of-card-background-color`
- `--of-card-padding-block-end`
- `--of-card-padding-block-start`
- `--of-card-padding-inline-end`
- `--of-card-padding-inline-start`

### Language-selection

If a form supports multiple languages and you don't render the language selection into a particular
node (provided at SDK init time), then you can control the spacing of the element using the
following design tokens:

- `--of-language-selection-in-app-padding-block-end`
- `--of-language-selection-in-app-padding-block-start`
- `--of-language-selection-in-app-mobile-padding-block-end`
- `--of-language-selection-in-app-mobile-padding-block-start`

### Form (step) summary

We've refactored our custom components to make use of NL Design System components.

**Step name/title**

The `h2` with classname `.openforms-summary__step-name` is now the Heading 2 component ( with
classnames `.utrecht-heading-2.utrecht-heading-2-openforms-summary-step-name`).

We have custom design tokens for the font-size and line-height that change the appearance to a
heading 3 element (for backwards compatibility). Relevant design tokens:

- `--of-summary-step-name-font-size`
- `--of-summary-step-name-line-height`

**Step header**

The step header now provides design tokens for the bottom padding (space between text and border)
and the bottom border. The default values are specified to be backwards compatible.

Relevant design tokens:

- `--of-summary-header-padding-block-end`
- `--of-summary-header-border-block-end-style`
- `--of-summary-header-border-block-end-width`
- `--of-summary-header-border-block-end-color`
